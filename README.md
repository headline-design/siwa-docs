Sign-In with Algorand is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Algorand account instead of relying on a traditional intermediary. Already used by multiple projects in the Algorand ecosystem, this effort standardizes the method with best practices and makes it easy to adopt securely.
